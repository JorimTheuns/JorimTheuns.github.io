    <h1>Homo Tempus:</h1>
    <img src="bone_and_slate/Bones_and_slate%20-%201.jpg">
    <h2>A study of past presence</h2>

    <h3>Showing at Maastricht Natural History Museum:
        3rd June – 14th August 2019
    </h3>

    <p>Maastricht Natural History Museum is proud to present: <i>Homo Tempus: A study of past presence</i> an exiting new exhibit about a species of hominid discovered in an Antarctic cave in 2010. A shock to the academic community and a continuing source of inspiration for many, Homo Tempus lived lives very different from our own. Their journey from the African continent to Antarctica and unique biology have baffled scientists for a decade, as had their highy advanced language.</p>

    <p>This leaflet provides additional information about the various pieces in the exhibit. Enjoy your visit.</p>

            <h4>A shocking discovery:</h4>
            <p>Archive material documenting the original find.<br> <i>Cori Tunsuno for The Aleph Gazette, Buenos Aires, 5th May 2010.</i></p>
            <p>After climate scientists, led by Professor Andrea Villares, discovered the cave on 10th January 2010, news of the find flooded Argentine media. After genetic analysis of the bones had been carried out and the ancient ancestor had been christened “Homo Tempus”: This article was published by the english language journal, <i>The Aleph Gazette</i>.</p>

            <p>Dr Jon Olafson is leading the research on the genetic lineage and migration of Homo Tempus. Dr Bruce Young carried out linguistic analysis of a slate tablet as part of his PhD, as well as working on a unified tranlation matix for Lingua Temporis: His supervisor, Dr Luibo Gese, recalled the uncanny similarity of the markings to series of multilingual tablets discovered in Morocco in the 19th Century.</p>

                    <p>Initial morphological studies suggest that Homo Tempus had a significantly higher brain-to-body ratio than Palaeolithic Homo Sapiens. This suggests Homo Tempus were significantly more intelligent than anything paleo anthropologists have previously seen. Homo Sapiens have been thought to be the most intelligent of the hominids. Until now.</p>

                    <p>Morphological research suggests that Homo Tempus had extremely large, strong, and dextrous hands. Abrasion at the fingertips suggests they had Incredibly strong nails, and the lack of tools at the cave site suggests they used their hands for most tasks. Further research is being conducted to investigate whether they used their fingers to inscribe the slate tablets found at the site.</p>

                    <i>Found Janurary 16th 2010, 67°30'21.9"S 66°28'36.1"W</i>
                    <p>The knee bone found at the site contained trace amounts of DNA, enabling mitochondrial analyisis of Homo-tempus's genetic lineage. Our earliest common anscestor is likley to have been Homo Erectus, a hominid that emerged in Africa 1.4 million years ago. Another genetic tree split from Homo Erectus 1.2 million years ago and evolved into Homo Tempus, living in africa and eventually Antarctica until at least 200,000 years ago.</p>

                    <p>As mostly cave dwellers, Homo Tempus likely had stout legs. Scaring along the dorsal axis indicates that the individual to which this bone belonged likely suffered a blunt force trauma early in life.</p>

            <p>A selection of inscriptions on slate recovered from the Antarctic cave. From Dr Young's 2018 paper: "Newly christened 'Lingua temporis' appears to be unlike any language previously studied. There are no references to objects per se, but of actions in diverging and converging, non-linear time. What we would call a plant, would be referred to as <i>growing, living, breathing, feeding,</i> all at once or in sequence depending on the writer's intent. Verbs are strung together in many branched, rhizomatic structures that tell stories of action networks relevant to the tale being told."</p>
