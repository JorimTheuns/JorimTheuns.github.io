            <p>As you travel away from the earth, the first atmospheric border you encounter is the Tropopause. This layer is the boundary between the Troposphere and Stratosphere. Upon ever closer inspection, its borderness disipates, this is not the physical and visible border we expect to see.
            <br>The borders between atmospheric layers signify changes in how atmospheric condtions change with altitude. they represent changing changes and as such, They do not mark, as diagrams and language illustrate and communicate, a distinguishable, binary division. By using words such as borders, boundaries and layers to define these invisible, physical gradients and phenomena, we as humans are let down by our lexicon.
                <br>Borders start with language. They start with us.<br>This poem explores these phenomena.</p>

            <p>The spirit is the abode of the past, the body of the present; the soul or spirit always anchored in the past, not residing in the present; lodged in the past and contemplating the present. To have or take consciousness of anything, means looking at it from the viewpoint of the past, in light of the past.</p>
