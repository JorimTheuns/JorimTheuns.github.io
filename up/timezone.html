        <p class="full-width justify-center">As we look up to space from our precious planetary vantage, time changes: with speed, gravity, distance. Time also changes as we travel around the globe: a passing by as a consequence of travel, but also due to timezones. Time zones are a socially (politically) constructed phenomenon that have been modified and altered over time, bent by those in power to suit all kinds of motives: cultural, poltical and economic. We created and curated the following content as an attempt to understand time from an atomic, geographical and social perspective, though multimedia and fiction.</p>

                    <p>New Year's eve, the most important holiday on the planet, the true differences between the 38, sovereign timestates are most intensly manifest. Plusones think they are special, celebrating an hour earlier, Negones likewise believe in some God given superiority, but we Noughties know better. Livestream beamers are being set up all over the city to connect the nation to itself. It is always surreal to see snows of the far north framed by Palm trees and sand, but I, and I know I speak for all Noughties, feel pride in being a part of the true beginning, and the true end, of UTC.</p>

A limit so distant, nothing that ever happened beyond there-then, will ever cause anything, at any point in the future, in our galactic neighbourhood. At such a distance, the space between here-now and there-then grows faster than the speed of light. Like running on an elastic road, stretching faster apart than anything can ever run.</p>
